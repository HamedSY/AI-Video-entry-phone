# Face Recognition Project - Raspberry Pi

This repository contains a **Face Recognition System** developed as a project for the **Computer Structure and Language (CSL)** course at Sharif University of Technology.
The system uses a **Raspberry Pi** connected to a phoneâ€™s camera for real-time face recognition, with additional features like capturing images and sending them via email.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Recognition**: Detect and recognize faces using OpenCV and the face recognition library.
- **Photo Capture**: Capture images when faces are detected.
- **Email Notifications**: Send captured images via email on demand.
